Fertilized eggs are then collected and placed in controlled environments for incubation. After hatching, the larvae are reared with specialized care, including precise feeding regimes. As they grow, they transition from live feed to artificial diets, a stage known as weaning. The juveniles are then moved to nursery tanks or ponds until they are large enough for grow-out ponds. Throughout the process, monitoring and grading ensure uniform growth. Finally, after reaching marketable size, the fish are harvested.
